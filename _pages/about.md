I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University. My research interests include computer vision, model compression, expert systems, and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiwen Yao of the Brain Lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University.
